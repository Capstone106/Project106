Income tax fraud poses a significant challenge to governments worldwide, undermining revenue collection. This project leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques to build a robust system capable of detecting tax fraud with high accuracy and efficiency. By harnessing diverse income tax datasets and focusing on algorithms such as Random Forest algorithm, the methodology centres on comprehensive data collection, encompassing   attributes crucial for fraud detection, serving as the bedrock for training   the algorithms. The core of the project is the implementation of the Random Forest Algorithm, an ensemble learning method known for its robustness and ability to handle complex classification problems. The algorithm analyzes patterns in taxpayer data, including income, deductions, expenses, and tax payments, to identify anomalies and predict potential fraud cases. By comparing actual tax paid with expected tax based on predefined tax slabs, the system flags discrepancies that might indicate fraudulent activities. The model was trained on a comprehensive dataset containing taxpayer financial records, including features such as income, deductions, and expenses. Through feature engineering, a crucial variable expected tax was computed to enhance the predictive power of the model. The system achieved high accuracy in detecting fraudulent cases, demonstrating the effectiveness of Random Forest in classification tasks. Ultimately, the proposed system seeks to automate income tax fraud detection, streamlining   processes, improving efficiency, and bolstering the security of tax assessments, thereby 
contributing to a more robust and effective tax system.
